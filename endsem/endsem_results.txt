# Question 01

RMS distance =  14.0209
√N =  14.1421

# Question 02

We do fitting with fourth order Legendre polynomial, i.e., with five fitting parameters.

A plot of data and fitted polynomial is given in "q2_fit.png".

Parameters for fitting with polynomials:
5-dimensional vector (double)
  0.06966 
  0.003624
 -0.01208 
  0.01143 
  0.1105  


# Question 03

Plot of temperature profile at different time steps is given in "q3_profile.png".

We see that the initial temperature profile "diffuses" with time and the rod is
coming to equilibrium. Moreover, from the contour plot in "q3_contour.png", we
can see that in 5000 time steps, due to both ends being held at 0°C, the entire
rod slowly goes to equilibrium at 0°C.

# Question 04

For this problem we have to do the integral: ∫dx/√(1 + x²) from -1 to +1
The exact answer is ln(1 + √2) - ln(-1 + √2) =  1.762747174
Gaussian quadrature with N = 4:  1.762054179
Gaussian quadrature with N = 5:  1.762855295
Gaussian quadrature with N = 6:  1.762730055
